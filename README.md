# EtchASketch

A dive into my Etch a Sketch project for The Odin Project.<br><br>
This was an excercise to practice DOM manipulation via javascript.<br><br>
The content was created using a combination of JS and CSS manipulating a single div in the HTML.<br><br>
NOTE : Having trouble with the greyscale function. I can not get it to accumulate for now.
